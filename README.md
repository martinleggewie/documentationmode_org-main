# documentationmode_org-main

Org Mode folder to showcase the "Documentation Mode" which contains configuration and some demo data for shared use in a team.

To get the whole Emacs and Org Mode configuration running without the need to change the concrete file paths, please clone this Git repo to your local file system to the path `$HOME/org/main`.
So, use a command like this

```
git clone https://github.com/martinleggewie/documentationmode_org-main ~/org/main
```

For all details about how to use this and why it makes sense please check my [tutorial about how to set-up the documentation mode](https://martinleggewie.github.io/documentationmode/how-to-configure.html)

Also check the "sibling" [Git repo which contains Org Mode configuration and demo data for personal use](https://github.com/martinleggewie/documentationmode_org-user).
